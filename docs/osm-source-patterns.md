# OSM Source Patterns

This project treats public OSM repositories as source-pattern evidence for Torii. Do not vendor external source code into the plugin. Borrow architecture, option names, and validation ideas only after checking license, dependencies, and Windows install risk.

## Source Map

| Project | Torii role | Pattern to borrow | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| OSMnx | Online Overpass network acquisition | Overpass subdivision, network-type presets, rate-limit pause, cache, retry on API pressure | Keep a lightweight local implementation; do not require heavy geospatial dependencies for the MVP |
| OSMNet | OSM graph extraction design | Road-class filtering, node/way deduplication, graph-oriented cleanup stages | Architecture reference only; do not vendor source code |
| pyrosm | Large-area and historical extract path | offline PBF reading, bbox filtering, custom tag filters, city/country-scale imports | Optional future dependency because geospatial wheels can be fragile on Windows |
| SUMO osmGet/osmBuild | SUMO-native import path | Overpass server fallback, tiles, `netconvert` option sets, polygon/background import flow | Prefer SUMO-native semantics when they differ from generic OSM libraries |
| osm-to-xodr | Conversion and metadata post-processing pattern | multi-stage netconvert, OpenDRIVE export, traffic-sign/signal metadata post-process | Reference for staged conversion/audit; not a controller implementation |

## Integration Ladder

1. Keep the current `sumo_osm_build_network` path lightweight: bbox, tiled Overpass, retry, XML deduplication, highway presets, and `netconvert`.
2. Add OSMnx-inspired Overpass controls next: endpoint fallback, rate-limit/status pause, local query cache, and richer network presets.
3. Add SUMO osmGet/osmBuild-inspired defaults: tile strategy, optional polygon/background generation, and documented `netconvert` option profiles.
4. Add a pyrosm-style offline PBF path for large regions, historical extracts, and repeated city-scale builds.
5. Add osm-to-xodr-style staged conversion records when the user needs OpenDRIVE, CARLA-style maps, or metadata post-processing.

## Observed OSM-to-SUMO Cleanup Profiles

These public scripts are useful workflow evidence, but they are not a substitute for TUM-style teacher replay. They mostly automate source preparation, filtering, and `netconvert` profiles; they do not guarantee TUM-equivalent connection, walkingarea, crossing, internal-edge, TLS phase, or `linkIndex` semantics.

| Source | Useful pattern | Torii implication | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|
| SUMO `osmGet.py` / `osmBuild.py` | SUMO-native OSM download, tiling, polygon/background handling, and option-file driven `netconvert` calls | Treat SUMO's own import stack as the first baseline before inventing another downloader/profile layer | Official defaults are generic OSM import behavior, not Ingolstadt teacher parity |
| sumo-berlin | Geofabrik extract preparation, bbox cropping/filtering, and repeatable scenario build scripting | Add offline-source prep as a stage before the current XML-centric Torii path | Do not feed `.osm.pbf` directly into current `source_osm_path` until a PBF prep/conversion step exists |
| MoSTScenario | Scenario workflow with OSM-like inputs, cleaning stages, and manual/recorded overrides | Preserve a logged transformation chain for every source and cleanup action | A city scenario build recipe is not a reusable proof of junction movement correctness |
| actrys | Shell-level `osmfilter` before `netconvert`, plus explicit import flags for ramps, isolated edges, joined junctions, and guessed TLS | Use these flags as small probe variants for routeability and topology feedback | Do not copy options that remove internal-link semantics, such as `--no-internal-links`, into TUM-style junction repair |

## Immediate Torii Probe

Keep `vehicle_core` and `reference_visual_detail` as separate profiles. For a candidate bbox, compare only one small junction at a time:

1. Build the current Torii OSM net.
2. Rebuild with one borrowed profile variant.
3. Compare approach-edge preservation, routeability, TLS/linkIndex delta, crossing/walkingarea delta, and NetEdit connection screenshots.
4. Promote an option only if it improves the same target junction without deleting teacher-required approaches or internal semantics.

## Region-Aware Baseline Rule

Use a region-aware external reality baseline for OSM/SUMO network and TLS existence audit. Google Maps can be the baseline where it is reliable and appropriate. For mainland China, use Amap/Gaode, Baidu Maps, Tencent Maps, official inventories, signal plans, or field photos, and record WGS84/GCJ-02/BD-09 coordinate-system assumptions.

Before using any map source to decide `keep_tls`, `remove_tls`, or `needs_review`, record whether the user wants the current map or a historical target date. If the user is modeling a historical network, do not treat the latest public map view as decisive unless imagery, street-level imagery, or inventory evidence matches the study period.

Minimum record:

```text
map_baseline_source:
regional_baseline_source:
coordinate_system: WGS84 | GCJ-02 | BD-09 | unknown
map_temporal_scope: current | historical | unspecified
map_target_date:
map_review_url:
audit_status:

time_scope_residual_risk:
