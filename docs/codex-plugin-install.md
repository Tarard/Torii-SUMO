# Codex Plugin Installation

`Torii` is distributed as a Codex plugin. Installing it provides both:

- the `simulation-helper-skill-for-eclipse-sumo` expert skill;
- the `torii-sumo` local stdio MCP server.

The skill is the reasoning layer. The MCP server is the execution layer.

The bundled `.mcp.json` starts `scripts/run_torii_sumo.py` through
`uv run --isolated --frozen --script`. The script declares its dependencies with
PEP 723 metadata and uses the adjacent `run_torii_sumo.py.lock` file. It can run
from an installed plugin cache without the repository root or a `python` command
on `PATH`. The retained `scripts/bootstrap_mcp.py` entry point checks the same
plugin-local runner and lock file. Plugin-launched MCP sessions default to the
10-tool `default` profile. Set `TORII_MCP_PROFILE=legacy` to expose all 73 legacy
tools, or `TORII_MCP_PROFILE=netedit` for only the NetEdit loop.

## CLI from an installed plugin

The plugin runner also provides the CLI. From the installed plugin root, use:

```powershell
uv run --isolated --frozen --script ./scripts/run_torii_sumo.py --cli workflows --json
uv run --isolated --frozen --script ./scripts/run_torii_sumo.py --cli workflow selected selection.json --json
```

Use an absolute runner path when another directory is current. Commands written
as `torii ...` in this guide and the bundled skill are shorthand for this runner
with `--cli`. A separate global `torii` installation is not required.

For a Windows NetEdit capture, `netedit review <source.net.xml> <new-output-dir>
<source-sha256>` opens a diagnostic copy, observes it, and closes it in one process.
The copied network and review artifacts remain in the output directory. Use the
persistent NetEdit MCP profile for multi-step edits. Separate CLI `open`, `observe`,
`act`, and `close` calls do not preserve a session and are rejected before action.

The Windows runtime explicitly includes pywin32 for the target-window session.
SUMO programs must still be available on `PATH`. Developers can install the tested
native binaries with `uv sync --extra dev --extra native`; CI uses SUMO 1.27.1 on
Windows and Linux and verifies its binaries before running tests.

## Repository Layout

The installable plugin root is:

```text
plugins/torii-sumo
```

The plugin manifest is:

```text
plugins/torii-sumo/.codex-plugin/plugin.json
```

The repo marketplace entry is:

```text
.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
```

## Local Development Install

From a local checkout, add the repository as a local marketplace:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add <path-to-this-repo>
codex plugin add torii-sumo@torii-sumo
```

Start a new Codex thread after installing or reinstalling so the skill and MCP tools are discovered in the new session.

## GitHub Install Shape

For a GitHub source, the expected marketplace command is:

```powershell
codex plugin marketplace add Tarard/Torii-SUMO --ref main
codex plugin add torii-sumo@torii-sumo
```

If the Codex CLI reports a marketplace-source mismatch, verify that `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` points to `./plugins/torii-sumo`.

## Usage Boundary

The plugin can run bounded environment checks, config preflight, smoke runs, output comparison, evidence bundle writing, and OSM/network construction helpers through MCP tools.

For one-sentence requests, start with the workflow router:

- `torii_auto_workflow`: classify the user's natural-language SUMO request, choose the workflow recipe, ask only blocking questions, and run safe MCP steps when enough evidence is available.

Implemented OSM/network interfaces:

- `sumo_osm_cleanup_workflow`: run this CLI-only workflow with `torii workflow`; it is not an MCP tool. Resolve a place and complete area confirmation to obtain a bbox first. Pass only `output_dir`, `bbox`, `profile`, `source_osm_path`, `traffic_layers`, `reference_net_file`, and `timeout_seconds`. The `standard` profile requires traffic layers. The `reference_matched` profile requires a reference `.net.xml`, audits differences, and does not apply repairs.
- `sumo_osm_build_network`: download or reuse an OSM extract, use tiled Overpass requests with retry, deduplicate merged OSM XML by object id, apply road-class presets or explicit highway classes, run `netconvert`, and return artifact/log paths.
- `sumo_tls_audit`: extract SUMO TLS audit candidates, cluster nearby candidates into physical-intersection review groups, and attach map-review baseline fields.
- `sumo_tls_multisource_review`: create a human-review CSV that combines SUMO TLS candidates with OSM traffic-signal matches, region-aware map links such as Amap/Gaode for mainland China or Google Maps where appropriate, Mapillary, KartaView, optional official signal inventory rows, optional signal-plan rows, and optional field-photo evidence rows.
- `sumo_network_tls_aggregation_variant`: create a separate TLS cleanup review network by selecting one real SUMO junction per physical TLS audit cluster, rebuilding TLS with `netconvert --tls.discard-loaded --tls.set`, and reporting raw physical cluster count versus aggregated `tlLogic`/traffic-light junction counts.
- `sumo_network_connected_core`: extract the largest passenger component from an existing SUMO `.net.xml`, write a reusable connected-core network, and report discarded fragments.
- `sumo_network_routeability_probe`: generate named-road probe routes and a bounded `.sumocfg` for routeability checks.
- `sumo_network_routeability_audit`: generate random passenger trips, run SUMO, parse `summary.xml` and `tripinfo.xml`, and extend the horizon until all generated vehicles finish or `max_end` is reached.
- `sumo_network_topology_audit`: audit dense junction clusters and short internal edges that indicate over-fragmented OSM/netconvert topology, including a reference-free `join` / `needs_map_review` / `do_not_join` aggregation scorer.
- `sumo_network_overlapping_junction_audit`: audit close overlapping top-level junctions without modifying the network, while ignoring valid SUMO internal crossing and walkingarea layers.
- `sumo_network_reference_join_audit`: mine joined-junction cases from a reference `.net.xml` and match them against the candidate network by encoded source nodes first, with spatial topology clusters as a fallback.
- `sumo_network_reference_hierarchy_audit`: compare high-hierarchy candidate roads against a reference `.net.xml`, separating over-split corridors, out-of-reference-scope high roads, hierarchy mismatches, and protected link/slip-lane cases.
- `sumo_network_reference_scope_audit`: compare a candidate reference-visual-detail network against a reference `.net.xml` by OSM `highway.*` type counts, then flag over-included or absent-in-reference short dead-end detail fragments for review.
- `sumo_network_junction_aggregation_variant`: create a separate junction-join review variant from topology, reference-join, or overlapping-junction audit reports without overwriting the source network; overlapping groups are joined only when reference or human review confirms the physical-intersection core.
- `sumo_network_scope_pruning_variant`: create a separate reference-scope pruning review variant from a scope audit without overwriting the source network.
- `sumo_network_teacher_guided_repair_queue`: execute ready teacher-guided repair queue items against explicit plain node/edge/connection files, replay and normalize the teacher target internal subgraph by default, aggregate construction and parity gates, and keep non-ready or parity-failing candidates out of adoption.
- `sumo_network_teacher_guided_junction_variant`: build a diagnostic single-junction variant that replays a manual reference network's lane permissions, allowed movements, pedestrian ring, target internal subgraph, and target `tlLogic` onto candidate plain network files by default. Set `replay_target_internal_subgraph=false` only for a legacy lane/connection-attribute probe. Keep it at `diagnostic-demo` until Netedit connection-mode review approves the result.

Use a region-aware reality baseline as supporting evidence for current-network OSM
cleanup. Record whether each source uses WGS84/GCJ-02/BD-09 when coordinate
systems differ. Unresolved TLS
candidates keep the result at `construction-invalid`. The cleanup command does
not open a GUI or repair these findings. For a historical target, supply a
frozen source OSM file and matching dated evidence.

External OSM source patterns are tracked from OSMnx, OSMNet, pyrosm, SUMO osmGet/osmBuild, and osm-to-xodr. Torii borrows architecture and validation ideas from these projects without vendoring their source code.

The plugin does not certify full OSM cleanup, an authoritative TLS inventory,
controller generation, or controller-log inspection through MCP. Resolve a
place and confirm its bbox before the CLI cleanup call. A reference-matched run
requires both that bbox and a reference `.net.xml`. It reports differences and
keeps all network changes for a separate reviewed step.
